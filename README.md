# Netflix_Clone
Welcome to my Netflix clone project repository! This project is my first attempt at cloning the popular streaming service, Netflix. It aims to replicate the core features and user interface of Netflix.

As a beginner in web development, I chose to create a clone of Netflix to improve my skills in HTML and CSS. This project allowed me to gain hands-on experience in building a responsive and interactive web application, as well as understanding the basics of front-end development.

 Contributions to the project are welcome! If you have any ideas for improvements, new features, or bug fixes, feel free to submit a pull request. Please follow the contribution guidelines when contributing to this project.
